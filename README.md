To start work with this generator you should only setup configurations:
'input_text': 't1.txt',   # Input text file (wavfile|text format or plain text)
'output_text': 't.txt',   # Output dataset file
'wave_path': 'audio/',    # wave path
This app is designed for fast voice dataset creation. When you have setting up all configurations you need to press "Enter" to start and then press "Enter" to stop. After this you have options: save and move to next, skip, or make the record again.
